## WireView: _NoFlo_-style wires on Android's canvas.

### What's this?
`WireView` is an Android project that contains a simple reusable `View` that can be used for rendering [NoFlo-style wires](https://github.com/flowhub/the-graph). I've made a couple of different wiring algorithms, but I've always admired how _NoFlo_'s twisted around the diagram. I figured it was time that other platforms could gain from these iconic representations of flow-based message passing.
